# TIC TAC TOE

### The Mission:
 * #### Build Tic Tac Toe from scratch!

In this homework, you will plan, pseudo code, and implement Tic Tac Toe!!!

This is a great stepping stone to creating your Unit One project and an excellent opportunity to plan and breakdown a problem first on paper, to understand its components before tackling the code.


### We encourage you to :
*  Play the game with someone else while thinking about the game logic.
* Whiteboard **ALL** the components your game will require!
* Pseudocode the complete logic to the last step

#### before writing a line of code!!!

### Things to think about:
- What is Tic Tac Toe? How is it played?
- What does it look like?
- How can you represent this programmatically?
- How can you use pseudocode to break down the functionality to the smallest piece?

Also, think about all the tools we've used so far:
- `strings`
- `numbers`
- `arrays`
- `objects`
- `functions`
- `booleans`
- `control flow structures`
- `DOM`

Which of these tools you are going to need to build this game?

### Completion

- You will need an `index.html`, a `main.js`, and a `style.css`.
- Your tic-tac-toe can be won and lost
- Your game should be played by 2 people taking turns 
- You've uploaded your completed tic tac toe game to GitHub pages.

### Submission 
- Remember your [homework workflow](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-hypatia/hypatia-students/blob/master/hw-workflow.md)
- In your issue ticket you will need the following:
    - A link to your fork of this repository with completed game
    - A link to your Tic Tac Toe on GitHub pages.
    - Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.
