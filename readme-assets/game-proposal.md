# Game proposals

Tonight please write a paragraph or two outlining your game idea. You don't have to go into tons of detail but make it specific enough that you feel comfortable pitching it.

### some things that might help guide your thinking:
- *Landing page:* What will a player see when they start your game?
- *Initialization:* What will a player see when the game is started?
- *Game play:* What will be the flow of the game, what will the user be expeted to do and what will the user expect from the game?
- *Win condition:* What does it look like when the game ends, what determines winning or losing?
- *Reset:* How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.
